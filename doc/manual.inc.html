<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-hisat">What is HISAT?</h2>
<p><a href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat">HISAT</a> is a fast and sensitive spliced alignment program. As part of HISAT, we have developed a new indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler_transform">BWT</a>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index">FM index</a>, called hierarchical indexing, that employs two types of indexes: (1) one global FM index representing the whole genome, and (2) many separate local FM indexes for small regions collectively covering the genome. Our hierarchical index for the human genome (about 3 billion bp) includes ~48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of ~64,000bp. As the basis for non-gapped alignment, the FM index is extremely fast with a low memory footprint, as demonstrated by <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sf.net">Bowtie</a>. In addition, HISAT provides several alignment strategies specifically designed for mapping different types of RNA-seq reads. All these together, HISAT enables extremely fast and sensitive alignment of reads, in particular those spanning two exons or more. As a result, HISAT is much faster &gt;50 times than <a href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat">TopHat2</a> with better alignment quality. Although it uses a large number of indexes, the memory requirement of HISAT is still modest, approximately 4.3 GB for human. HISAT uses the <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sf.net/bowtie2">Bowtie2</a> implementation to handle most of the operations on the FM index. In addition to spliced alignment, HISAT handles reads involving indels and supports a paired-end alignment mode. Multiple processors can be used simultaneously to achieve greater alignment speed. HISAT outputs alignments in <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">SAM</a> format, enabling interoperation with a large number of other tools (e.g. <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net">SAMtools</a>, <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsa/wiki/index.php/The_Genome_Analysis_Toolkit">GATK</a>) that use SAM. HISAT is distributed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3 license</a>, and it runs on the command line under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.</p>
<h1 id="obtaining-hisat">Obtaining HISAT</h1>
<p>Download HISAT sources and binaries from the Releases sections on the right side. Binaries are available for Intel architectures (<code>x86_64</code>) running Linux, and Mac OS X.</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building from source</h2>
<p>Building HISAT from source requires a GNU-like environment with GCC, GNU Make and other basics. It should be possible to build HISAT on most vanilla Linux installations or on a Mac installation with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> installed. HISAT can also be built on Windows using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> or <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> (MinGW recommended). For a MinGW build the choice of what compiler is to be used is important since this will determine if a 32 or 64 bit code can be successfully compiled using it. If there is a need to generate both 32 and 64 bit on the same machine then a multilib MinGW has to be properly installed. <a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys">MSYS</a>, the <a href="http://cygwin.com/packages/mingw-zlib/">zlib</a> library, and depending on architecture <a href="http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/">pthreads</a> library are also required. We are recommending a 64 bit build since it has some clear advantages in real life research problems. In order to simplify the MinGW setup it might be worth investigating popular MinGW personal builds since these are coming already prepared with most of the toolchains needed.</p>
<p>First, download the <a href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat/downloads/hisat-0.1.5-beta-source.zip">source package</a> from the Releases secion on the right side. Unzip the file, change to the unzipped directory, and build the HISAT tools by running GNU <code>make</code> (usually with the command <code>make</code>, but sometimes with <code>gmake</code>) with no arguments. If building with MinGW, run <code>make</code> from the MSYS environment.</p>
<p>HISAT is using the multithreading software model in order to speed up execution times on SMP architectures where this is possible. On POSIX platforms (like linux, Mac OS, etc) it needs the pthread library. Although it is possible to use pthread library on non-POSIX platform like Windows, due to performance reasons HISAT will try to use Windows native multithreading if possible.</p>
<p>For the support of SRA data access in HISAT, please download and install the <a href="https://github.com/ncbi/ngs/wiki/Downloads">NCBI-NGS</a> toolkit. When running <code>make</code>, specify additional variables as follow. <code>make USE_SRA=1 NCBI_NGS_DIR=/path/to/NCBI-NGS-directory NCBI_VDB_DIR=/path/to/NCBI-NGS-directory</code>, where <code>NCBI_NGS_DIR</code> and <code>NCBI_VDB_DIR</code> will be used in Makefile for -I and -L compilation options. For example, $(NCBI_NGS_DIR)/include and $(NCBI_NGS_DIR)/lib64 will be used.</p>
<h1 id="running-hisat">Running HISAT</h1>
<h2 id="adding-to-path">Adding to PATH</h2>
<p>By adding your new HISAT directory to your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH environment variable</a>, you ensure that whenever you run <code>hisat</code>, <code>hisat-build</code> or <code>hisat-inspect</code> from the command line, you will get the version you just installed without having to specify the entire path. This is recommended for most users. To do this, follow your operating system's instructions for adding the directory to your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to install HISAT by copying the HISAT executable files to an existing directory in your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH</a>, make sure that you copy all the executables, including <code>hisat</code>, <code>hisat-align-s</code>, <code>hisat-align-l</code>, <code>hisat-build</code>, <code>hisat-build-s</code>, <code>hisat-build-l</code>, <code>hisat-inspect</code>, <code>hisat-inspect-s</code> and <code>hisat-inspect-l</code>.</p>
<h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
<p>The reporting mode governs how many alignments HISAT looks for, and how to report them.</p>
<p>In general, when we say that a read has an alignment, we mean that it has a <a href="#valid-alignments-meet-or-exceed-the-minimum-score-threshold">valid alignment</a>. When we say that a read has multiple alignments, we mean that it has multiple alignments that are valid and distinct from one another.</p>
<h3 id="distinct-alignments-map-a-read-to-different-places">Distinct alignments map a read to different places</h3>
<p>Two alignments for the same individual read are &quot;distinct&quot; if they map the same read to different places. Specifically, we say that two alignments are distinct if there are no alignment positions where a particular read offset is aligned opposite a particular reference offset in both alignments with the same orientation. E.g. if the first alignment is in the forward orientation and aligns the read character at read offset 10 to the reference character at chromosome 3, offset 3,445,245, and the second alignment is also in the forward orientation and also aligns the read character at read offset 10 to the reference character at chromosome 3, offset 3,445,245, they are not distinct alignments.</p>
<p>Two alignments for the same pair are distinct if either the mate 1s in the two paired-end alignments are distinct or the mate 2s in the two alignments are distinct or both.</p>
<!--
### Default mode: search for multiple alignments, report the best one

By default, HISAT searches for distinct, valid alignments for each read. When
it finds a valid alignment, it generally will continue to look for alignments
that are nearly as good or better.  It will eventually stop looking, either
because it exceeded a limit placed on search effort (see [`-D`] and [`-R`]) or
because it already knows all it needs to know to report an alignment.
Information from the best alignments are used to estimate mapping quality (the
`MAPQ` [SAM] field) and to set SAM optional fields, such as [`AS:i`] and
[`XS:i`].  HISAT does not gaurantee that the alignment reported is the best
possible in terms of alignment score.
-->

<h3 id="default-mode-search-for-one-or-more-alignments-report-each">Default mode: search for one or more alignments, report each</h3>
<p>HISAT searches for up to N distinct, primary alignments for each read, where N equals the integer specified with the <code>-k</code> parameter. Primary alignments mean alignments whose alignment score is equal or higher than any other alignments. It is possible that multiple distinct alignments whave the same score. That is, if <code>-k 2</code> is specified, HISAT will search for at most 2 distinct alignments. The alignment score for a paired-end alignment equals the sum of the alignment scores of the individual mates. Each reported read or pair alignment beyond the first has the SAM 'secondary' bit (which equals 256) set in its FLAGS field. See the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">SAM specification</a> for details.</p>
<p>HISAT does not &quot;find&quot; alignments in any specific order, so for reads that have more than N distinct, valid alignments, HISAT does not gaurantee that the N alignments reported are the best possible in terms of alignment score. Still, this mode can be effective and fast in situations where the user cares more about whether a read aligns (or aligns a certain number of times) than where exactly it originated.</p>
<h2 id="alignment-summmary">Alignment summmary</h2>
<p>When HISAT finishes running, it prints messages summarizing what happened. These messages are printed to the &quot;standard error&quot; (&quot;stderr&quot;) filehandle. For datasets consisting of unpaired reads, the summary might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>20000 reads; of these:
  20000 (100.00%) were unpaired; of these:
    1247 (6.24%) aligned 0 times
    18739 (93.69%) aligned exactly 1 time
    14 (0.07%) aligned &gt;1 times
93.77% overall alignment rate</code></pre>
<p>For datasets consisting of pairs, the summary might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>10000 reads; of these:
  10000 (100.00%) were paired; of these:
    650 (6.50%) aligned concordantly 0 times
    8823 (88.23%) aligned concordantly exactly 1 time
    527 (5.27%) aligned concordantly &gt;1 times
    ----
    650 pairs aligned concordantly 0 times; of these:
      34 (5.23%) aligned discordantly 1 time
    ----
    616 pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly; of these:
      1232 mates make up the pairs; of these:
        660 (53.57%) aligned 0 times
        571 (46.35%) aligned exactly 1 time
        1 (0.08%) aligned &gt;1 times
96.70% overall alignment rate</code></pre>
<p>The indentation indicates how subtotals relate to totals.</p>
<h2 id="wrapper">Wrapper</h2>
<p>The <code>hisat</code>, <code>hisat-build</code> and <code>hisat-inspect</code> executables are actually wrapper scripts that call binary programs as appropriate. The wrappers shield users from having to distinguish between &quot;small&quot; and &quot;large&quot; index formats, discussed briefly in the following section. Also, the <code>hisat</code> wrapper provides some key functionality, like the ability to handle compressed inputs, and the fucntionality for <a href="#hisat-options-un"><code>--un</code></a>, <a href="#hisat-options-al"><code>--al</code></a> and related options.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you always run the hisat wrappers and not run the binaries directly.</p>
<h2 id="small-and-large-indexes">Small and large indexes</h2>
<p><code>hisat-build</code> can index reference genomes of any size. For genomes less than about 4 billion nucleotides in length, <code>hisat-build</code> builds a &quot;small&quot; index using 32-bit numbers in various parts of the index. When the genome is longer, <code>hisat-build</code> builds a &quot;large&quot; index using 64-bit numbers. Small indexes are stored in files with the <code>.bt2</code> extension, and large indexes are stored in files with the <code>.bt2l</code> extension. The user need not worry about whether a particular index is small or large; the wrapper scripts will automatically build and use the appropriate index.</p>
<h2 id="performance-tuning">Performance tuning</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If your computer has multiple processors/cores, use <code>-p</code></p>
<p>The <a href="#hisat-options-p"><code>-p</code></a> option causes HISAT to launch a specified number of parallel search threads. Each thread runs on a different processor/core and all threads find alignments in parallel, increasing alignment throughput by approximately a multiple of the number of threads (though in practice, speedup is somewhat worse than linear).</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="command-line">Command Line</h2>
<h3 id="setting-function-options">Setting function options</h3>
<p>Some HISAT options specify a function rather than an individual number or setting. In these cases the user specifies three parameters: (a) a function type <code>F</code>, (b) a constant term <code>B</code>, and (c) a coefficient <code>A</code>. The available function types are constant (<code>C</code>), linear (<code>L</code>), square-root (<code>S</code>), and natural log (<code>G</code>). The parameters are specified as <code>F,B,A</code> - that is, the function type, the constant term, and the coefficient are separated by commas with no whitespace. The constant term and coefficient may be negative and/or floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>For example, if the function specification is <code>L,-0.4,-0.6</code>, then the function defined is:</p>
<pre><code>f(x) = -0.4 + -0.6 * x</code></pre>
<p>If the function specification is <code>G,1,5.4</code>, then the function defined is:</p>
<pre><code>f(x) = 1.0 + 5.4 * ln(x)</code></pre>
<p>See the documentation for the option in question to learn what the parameter <code>x</code> is for. For example, in the case if the <a href="#hisat-options-score-min"><code>--score-min</code></a> option, the function <code>f(x)</code> sets the minimum alignment score necessary for an alignment to be considered valid, and <code>x</code> is the read length.</p>

are less than or equal to 0, and the greatest possible alignment score is 0.
This is mutually exclusive with [`--local`].  `--end-to-end` is the default mode.

</td><td>

In this mode, HISAT does not require that the entire read align from one end
to the other.  Rather, some characters may be omitted ("soft clipped") from the
ends in order to achieve the greatest possible alignment score.  The match bonus
[`--ma`] is used in this mode, and the best possible alignment score is equal to
the match bonus ([`--ma`]) times the length of the read.  Specifying `--local`
and one of the presets (e.g. `--local --very-fast`) is equivalent to specifying
the local version of the preset (`--very-fast-local`).  This is mutually
exclusive with [`--end-to-end`].  `--end-to-end` is the default mode.

<p>Each subsequnt line describes an alignment or, if the read failed to align, a read. Each line is a collection of at least 12 fields separated by tabs; from left to right, the fields are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Name of read that aligned.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">SAM specification</a> disallows whitespace in the read name. If the read name contains any whitespace characters, HISAT will truncate the name at the first whitespace character. This is similar to the behavior of other tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Sum of all applicable flags. Flags relevant to HISAT are:</p>
<table><tr><td>

<pre><code>1</code></pre>
</td><td>

<p>The read is one of a pair</p>

<h1 id="the-hisat-build-indexer">The <code>hisat-build</code> indexer</h1>
<p><code>hisat-build</code> builds a HISAT index from a set of DNA sequences. <code>hisat-build</code> outputs a set of 6 files with suffixes <code>.1.bt2</code>, <code>.2.bt2</code>, <code>.3.bt2</code>, <code>.4.bt2</code>, <code>.rev.1.bt2</code>, and <code>.rev.2.bt2</code>. In the case of a large index these suffixes will have a <code>bt2l</code> termination. These files together constitute the index: they are all that is needed to align reads to that reference. The original sequence FASTA files are no longer used by HISAT once the index is built.</p>
<p>Use of Karkkainen's <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1314852">blockwise algorithm</a> allows <code>hisat-build</code> to trade off between running time and memory usage. <code>hisat-build</code> has three options governing how it makes this trade: <a href="#hisat-build-options-p"><code>-p</code>/<code>--packed</code></a>, <a href="#hisat-build-options-bmax"><code>--bmax</code></a>/<a href="#hisat-build-options-bmaxdivn"><code>--bmaxdivn</code></a>, and <a href="#hisat-build-options-dcv"><code>--dcv</code></a>. By default, <code>hisat-build</code> will automatically search for the settings that yield the best running time without exhausting memory. This behavior can be disabled using the <a href="#hisat-build-options-a"><code>-a</code>/<code>--noauto</code></a> option.</p>
<p>The indexer provides options pertaining to the &quot;shape&quot; of the index, e.g. <a href="#hisat-build-options-o"><code>--offrate</code></a> governs the fraction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler_transform">Burrows-Wheeler</a> rows that are &quot;marked&quot; (i.e., the density of the suffix-array sample; see the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index">FM Index</a> paper for details). All of these options are potentially profitable trade-offs depending on the application. They have been set to defaults that are reasonable for most cases according to our experiments. See <a href="#performance-tuning">Performance tuning</a> for details.</p>
<p><code>hisat-build</code> can generate either <a href="#small-and-large-indexes">small or large indexes</a>. The wrapper will decide which based on the length of the input genome. If the reference does not exceed 4 billion characters but a large index is preferred, the user can specify <a href="#hisat-build-options-large-index"><code>--large-index</code></a> to force <code>hisat-build</code> to build a large index instead.</p>
<p>The HISAT index is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index">FM Index</a> of Ferragina and Manzini, which in turn is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler_transform">Burrows-Wheeler</a> transform. The algorithm used to build the index is based on the <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1314852">blockwise algorithm</a> of Karkkainen.</p>

<h1 id="getting-started-with-hisat">Getting started with HISAT</h1>
<p>HISAT comes with some example files to get you started. The example files are not scientifically significant; these files will simply let you start running HISAT and downstream tools right away.</p>
<p>First follow the manual instructions to <a href="#obtaining-hisat">obtain HISAT</a>. Set the <code>HISAT_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the new HISAT directory containing the <code>hisat</code>, <code>hisat-build</code> and <code>hisat-inspect</code> binaries. This is important, as the <code>HISAT_HOME</code> variable is used in the commands below to refer to that directory.</p>
<h2 id="indexing-a-reference-genome">Indexing a reference genome</h2>
<p>To create an index for the genomic region (1 million bps from the human chromosome 22 between 20,000,000 and 20,999,999) included with HISAT, create a new temporary directory (it doesn't matter where), change into that directory, and run:</p>
<pre><code>$HISAT_HOME/hisat-build $HISAT_HOME/example/reference/22_20-21M.fa 22_20-21M_hisat</code></pre>
<p>The command should print many lines of output then quit. When the command completes, the current directory will contain ten new files that all start with <code>22_20-21M_hisat</code> and end with <code>.1.bt2</code>, <code>.2.bt2</code>, <code>.3.bt2</code>, <code>.4.bt2</code>, <code>.5.bt2</code>, <code>.6.bt2</code>, <code>.rev.1.bt2</code>, <code>.rev.2.bt2</code>, <code>.rev.5.bt2</code>, and <code>.rev.6.bt2</code>. These files constitute the index - you're done!</p>
<p>You can use <code>hisat-build</code> to create an index for a set of FASTA files obtained from any source, including sites such as <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway">UCSC</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/genome">NCBI</a>, and <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a>. When indexing multiple FASTA files, specify all the files using commas to separate file names. For more details on how to create an index with <code>hisat-build</code>, see the <a href="#the-hisat-build-indexer">manual section on index building</a>. You may also want to bypass this process by obtaining a pre-built index.</p>
<h2 id="aligning-example-reads">Aligning example reads</h2>
<p>Stay in the directory created in the previous step, which now contains the <code>22_20-21M_hisat</code> index files. Next, run:</p>
<pre><code>$HISAT_HOME/hisat -x 22_20-21M_hisat -U $HISAT_HOME/example/reads/reads_1.fq -S eg1.sam</code></pre>
<p>This runs the HISAT aligner, which aligns a set of unpaired reads to the the genome region using the index generated in the previous step. The alignment results in SAM format are written to the file <code>eg1.sam</code>, and a short alignment summary is written to the console. (Actually, the summary is written to the &quot;standard error&quot; or &quot;stderr&quot; filehandle, which is typically printed to the console.)</p>
<p>To see the first few lines of the SAM output, run:</p>
<pre><code>head eg1.sam</code></pre>
<p>You will see something like this:</p>

<p>The first few lines (beginning with <code>@</code>) are SAM header lines, and the rest of the lines are SAM alignments, one line per read or mate. See the <a href="#sam-output">HISAT manual section on SAM output</a> and the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">SAM specification</a> for details about how to interpret the SAM file format.</p>
<h2 id="paired-end-example">Paired-end example</h2>
<p>To align paired-end reads included with HISAT, stay in the same directory and run:</p>
<pre><code>$HISAT_HOME/hisat -x 22_20-21M_hisat -1 $HISAT_HOME/example/reads/reads_1.fq -2 $HISAT_HOME/example/reads/reads_2.fq -S eg2.sam</code></pre>
<p>This aligns a set of paired-end reads to the reference genome, with results written to the file <code>eg2.sam</code>.</p>
<h2 id="using-samtoolsbcftools-downstream">Using SAMtools/BCFtools downstream</h2>
<p><a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net">SAMtools</a> is a collection of tools for manipulating and analyzing SAM and BAM alignment files. <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml">BCFtools</a> is a collection of tools for calling variants and manipulating VCF and BCF files, and it is typically distributed with <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net">SAMtools</a>. Using these tools together allows you to get from alignments in SAM format to variant calls in VCF format. This example assumes that <code>samtools</code> and <code>bcftools</code> are installed and that the directories containing these binaries are in your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH environment variable</a>.</p>
<p>Run the paired-end example:</p>
<pre><code>$HISAT_HOME/hisat -x $HISAT_HOME/example/index/22_20-21M_hisat -1 $HISAT_HOME/example/reads/reads_1.fq -2 $HISAT_HOME/example/reads/reads_2.fq -S eg2.sam</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>samtools view</code> to convert the SAM file into a BAM file. BAM is a the binary format corresponding to the SAM text format. Run:</p>
<pre><code>samtools view -bS eg2.sam &gt; eg2.bam</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>samtools sort</code> to convert the BAM file to a sorted BAM file.</p>
<pre><code>samtools sort eg2.bam eg2.sorted</code></pre>
<p>We now have a sorted BAM file called <code>eg2.sorted.bam</code>. Sorted BAM is a useful format because the alignments are (a) compressed, which is convenient for long-term storage, and (b) sorted, which is conveneint for variant discovery. To generate variant calls in VCF format, run:</p>
<pre><code>samtools mpileup -uf $HISAT_HOME/example/reference/22_20-21M.fa eg2.sorted.bam | bcftools view -bvcg - &gt; eg2.raw.bcf</code></pre>
<p>Then to view the variants, run:</p>
<pre><code>bcftools view eg2.raw.bcf</code></pre>
<p>See the official SAMtools guide to <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml">Calling SNPs/INDELs with SAMtools/BCFtools</a> for more details and variations on this process.</p>
