<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-hisat2">What is HISAT2?</h2>
<p>HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation sequencing reads (whole-genome, transcriptome, and exome sequencing data) against the general human population (as well as against a single reference genome). Based on <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6698337&amp;tag=1">GCSA</a> (an extension of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler_transform">BWT</a> for a graph), we designed and implemented a graph FM index (GFM), an original approach and its first implementation to the best of our knowledge. In addition to using one global GFM index that represents general population, HISAT2 uses a large set of small GFM indexes that collectively cover the whole genome (each index representing a genomic region of 56 Kbp, with 55,000 indexes needed to cover human population). These small indexes (called local indexes) combined with several alignment strategies enable effective alignment of sequencing reads. This new indexing scheme is called Hierarchical Graph FM index (HGFM). We have developed HISAT 2 based on the <a href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat">HISAT</a> and <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sf.net/bowtie2">Bowtie2</a> implementations. HISAT2 outputs alignments in <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">SAM</a> format, enabling interoperation with a large number of other tools (e.g. <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net">SAMtools</a>, <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsa/wiki/index.php/The_Genome_Analysis_Toolkit">GATK</a>) that use SAM. HISAT2 is distributed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3 license</a>, and it runs on the command line under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.</p>
<h1 id="obtaining-hisat2">Obtaining HISAT2</h1>
<p>Download HISAT2 sources and binaries from the Releases sections on the right side. Binaries are available for Intel architectures (<code>x86_64</code>) running Linux, and Mac OS X.</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building from source</h2>
<p>Building HISAT2 from source requires a GNU-like environment with GCC, GNU Make and other basics. It should be possible to build HISAT2 on most vanilla Linux installations or on a Mac installation with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> installed. HISAT2 can also be built on Windows using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> or <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> (MinGW recommended). For a MinGW build the choice of what compiler is to be used is important since this will determine if a 32 or 64 bit code can be successfully compiled using it. If there is a need to generate both 32 and 64 bit on the same machine then a multilib MinGW has to be properly installed. <a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys">MSYS</a>, the <a href="http://cygwin.com/packages/mingw-zlib/">zlib</a> library, and depending on architecture <a href="http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/">pthreads</a> library are also required. We are recommending a 64 bit build since it has some clear advantages in real life research problems. In order to simplify the MinGW setup it might be worth investigating popular MinGW personal builds since these are coming already prepared with most of the toolchains needed.</p>
<p>First, download the <a href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/downloads/hisat2-2.0.0-beta-source.zip">source package</a> from the Releases secion on the right side. Unzip the file, change to the unzipped directory, and build the HISAT2 tools by running GNU <code>make</code> (usually with the command <code>make</code>, but sometimes with <code>gmake</code>) with no arguments. If building with MinGW, run <code>make</code> from the MSYS environment.</p>
<p>HISAT2 is using the multithreading software model in order to speed up execution times on SMP architectures where this is possible. On POSIX platforms (like linux, Mac OS, etc) it needs the pthread library. Although it is possible to use pthread library on non-POSIX platform like Windows, due to performance reasons HISAT2 will try to use Windows native multithreading if possible.</p>
<p>For the support of SRA data access in HISAT2, please download and install the <a href="https://github.com/ncbi/ngs/wiki/Downloads">NCBI-NGS</a> toolkit. When running <code>make</code>, specify additional variables as follow. <code>make USE_SRA=1 NCBI_NGS_DIR=/path/to/NCBI-NGS-directory NCBI_VDB_DIR=/path/to/NCBI-NGS-directory</code>, where <code>NCBI_NGS_DIR</code> and <code>NCBI_VDB_DIR</code> will be used in Makefile for -I and -L compilation options. For example, $(NCBI_NGS_DIR)/include and $(NCBI_NGS_DIR)/lib64 will be used.</p>
<h1 id="running-hisat2">Running HISAT2</h1>
<h2 id="adding-to-path">Adding to PATH</h2>
<p>By adding your new HISAT2 directory to your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH environment variable</a>, you ensure that whenever you run <code>hisat2</code>, <code>hisat2-build</code> or <code>hisat2-inspect</code> from the command line, you will get the version you just installed without having to specify the entire path. This is recommended for most users. To do this, follow your operating system's instructions for adding the directory to your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to install HISAT2 by copying the HISAT2 executable files to an existing directory in your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH</a>, make sure that you copy all the executables, including <code>hisat2</code>, <code>hisat2-align-s</code>, <code>hisat2-align-l</code>, <code>hisat2-build</code>, <code>hisat2-build-s</code>, <code>hisat2-build-l</code>, <code>hisat2-inspect</code>, <code>hisat2-inspect-s</code> and <code>hisat2-inspect-l</code>.</p>
<h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
<p>The reporting mode governs how many alignments HISAT2 looks for, and how to report them.</p>
<p>In general, when we say that a read has an alignment, we mean that it has a <a href="#valid-alignments-meet-or-exceed-the-minimum-score-threshold">valid alignment</a>. When we say that a read has multiple alignments, we mean that it has multiple alignments that are valid and distinct from one another.</p>
<h3 id="distinct-alignments-map-a-read-to-different-places">Distinct alignments map a read to different places</h3>
<p>Two alignments for the same individual read are &quot;distinct&quot; if they map the same read to different places. Specifically, we say that two alignments are distinct if there are no alignment positions where a particular read offset is aligned opposite a particular reference offset in both alignments with the same orientation. E.g. if the first alignment is in the forward orientation and aligns the read character at read offset 10 to the reference character at chromosome 3, offset 3,445,245, and the second alignment is also in the forward orientation and also aligns the read character at read offset 10 to the reference character at chromosome 3, offset 3,445,245, they are not distinct alignments.</p>
<p>Two alignments for the same pair are distinct if either the mate 1s in the two paired-end alignments are distinct or the mate 2s in the two alignments are distinct or both.</p>
<!--
### Default mode: search for multiple alignments, report the best one

By default, HISAT2 searches for distinct, valid alignments for each read. When
it finds a valid alignment, it generally will continue to look for alignments
that are nearly as good or better.  It will eventually stop looking, either
because it exceeded a limit placed on search effort (see [`-D`] and [`-R`]) or
because it already knows all it needs to know to report an alignment.
Information from the best alignments are used to estimate mapping quality (the
`MAPQ` [SAM] field) and to set SAM optional fields, such as [`AS:i`] and
[`XS:i`].  HISAT2 does not gaurantee that the alignment reported is the best
possible in terms of alignment score.
-->

<h3 id="default-mode-search-for-one-or-more-alignments-report-each">Default mode: search for one or more alignments, report each</h3>
<p>HISAT2 searches for up to N distinct, primary alignments for each read, where N equals the integer specified with the <code>-k</code> parameter. Primary alignments mean alignments whose alignment score is equal or higher than any other alignments. It is possible that multiple distinct alignments whave the same score. That is, if <code>-k 2</code> is specified, HISAT2 will search for at most 2 distinct alignments. The alignment score for a paired-end alignment equals the sum of the alignment scores of the individual mates. Each reported read or pair alignment beyond the first has the SAM 'secondary' bit (which equals 256) set in its FLAGS field. See the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">SAM specification</a> for details.</p>
<p>HISAT2 does not &quot;find&quot; alignments in any specific order, so for reads that have more than N distinct, valid alignments, HISAT2 does not gaurantee that the N alignments reported are the best possible in terms of alignment score. Still, this mode can be effective and fast in situations where the user cares more about whether a read aligns (or aligns a certain number of times) than where exactly it originated.</p>
<h2 id="alignment-summmary">Alignment summmary</h2>
<p>When HISAT2 finishes running, it prints messages summarizing what happened. These messages are printed to the &quot;standard error&quot; (&quot;stderr&quot;) filehandle. For datasets consisting of unpaired reads, the summary might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>20000 reads; of these:
  20000 (100.00%) were unpaired; of these:
    1247 (6.24%) aligned 0 times
    18739 (93.69%) aligned exactly 1 time
    14 (0.07%) aligned &gt;1 times
93.77% overall alignment rate</code></pre>
<p>For datasets consisting of pairs, the summary might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>10000 reads; of these:
  10000 (100.00%) were paired; of these:
    650 (6.50%) aligned concordantly 0 times
    8823 (88.23%) aligned concordantly exactly 1 time
    527 (5.27%) aligned concordantly &gt;1 times
    ----
    650 pairs aligned concordantly 0 times; of these:
      34 (5.23%) aligned discordantly 1 time
    ----
    616 pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly; of these:
      1232 mates make up the pairs; of these:
        660 (53.57%) aligned 0 times
        571 (46.35%) aligned exactly 1 time
        1 (0.08%) aligned &gt;1 times
96.70% overall alignment rate</code></pre>
<p>The indentation indicates how subtotals relate to totals.</p>
<h2 id="wrapper">Wrapper</h2>
<p>The <code>hisat2</code>, <code>hisat2-build</code> and <code>hisat2-inspect</code> executables are actually wrapper scripts that call binary programs as appropriate. The wrappers shield users from having to distinguish between &quot;small&quot; and &quot;large&quot; index formats, discussed briefly in the following section. Also, the <code>hisat2</code> wrapper provides some key functionality, like the ability to handle compressed inputs, and the fucntionality for <a href="#hisat2-options-un"><code>--un</code></a>, <a href="#hisat2-options-al"><code>--al</code></a> and related options.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you always run the hisat2 wrappers and not run the binaries directly.</p>
<h2 id="small-and-large-indexes">Small and large indexes</h2>
<p><code>hisat2-build</code> can index reference genomes of any size. For genomes less than about 4 billion nucleotides in length, <code>hisat2-build</code> builds a &quot;small&quot; index using 32-bit numbers in various parts of the index. When the genome is longer, <code>hisat2-build</code> builds a &quot;large&quot; index using 64-bit numbers. Small indexes are stored in files with the <code>.ht2</code> extension, and large indexes are stored in files with the <code>.ht2l</code> extension. The user need not worry about whether a particular index is small or large; the wrapper scripts will automatically build and use the appropriate index.</p>
<h2 id="performance-tuning">Performance tuning</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If your computer has multiple processors/cores, use <code>-p</code></p>
<p>The <a href="#hisat2-options-p"><code>-p</code></a> option causes HISAT2 to launch a specified number of parallel search threads. Each thread runs on a different processor/core and all threads find alignments in parallel, increasing alignment throughput by approximately a multiple of the number of threads (though in practice, speedup is somewhat worse than linear).</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="command-line">Command Line</h2>
<h3 id="setting-function-options">Setting function options</h3>
<p>Some HISAT2 options specify a function rather than an individual number or setting. In these cases the user specifies three parameters: (a) a function type <code>F</code>, (b) a constant term <code>B</code>, and (c) a coefficient <code>A</code>. The available function types are constant (<code>C</code>), linear (<code>L</code>), square-root (<code>S</code>), and natural log (<code>G</code>). The parameters are specified as <code>F,B,A</code> - that is, the function type, the constant term, and the coefficient are separated by commas with no whitespace. The constant term and coefficient may be negative and/or floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>For example, if the function specification is <code>L,-0.4,-0.6</code>, then the function defined is:</p>
<pre><code>f(x) = -0.4 + -0.6 * x</code></pre>
<p>If the function specification is <code>G,1,5.4</code>, then the function defined is:</p>
<pre><code>f(x) = 1.0 + 5.4 * ln(x)</code></pre>
<p>See the documentation for the option in question to learn what the parameter <code>x</code> is for. For example, in the case if the <a href="#hisat2-options-score-min"><code>--score-min</code></a> option, the function <code>f(x)</code> sets the minimum alignment score necessary for an alignment to be considered valid, and <code>x</code> is the read length.</p>

[`--end-to-end`]: #hisat2-options-end-to-end

    --end-to-end

</td><td>

In this mode, HISAT2 requires that the entire read align from one end to the
other, without any trimming (or "soft clipping") of characters from either end.
The match bonus [`--ma`] always equals 0 in this mode, so all alignment scores
are less than or equal to 0, and the greatest possible alignment score is 0.
This is mutually exclusive with [`--local`].  `--end-to-end` is the default mode.

[`--local`]: #hisat2-options-local

    --local

</td><td>

In this mode, HISAT2 does not require that the entire read align from one end
to the other.  Rather, some characters may be omitted ("soft clipped") from the
ends in order to achieve the greatest possible alignment score.  The match bonus
[`--ma`] is used in this mode, and the best possible alignment score is equal to
the match bonus ([`--ma`]) times the length of the read.  Specifying `--local`
and one of the presets (e.g. `--local --very-fast`) is equivalent to specifying
the local version of the preset (`--very-fast-local`).  This is mutually
exclusive with [`--end-to-end`].  `--end-to-end` is the default mode.

<p>Normally, HISAT2 re-initializes its pseudo-random generator for each read. It seeds the generator with a number derived from (a) the read name, (b) the nucleotide sequence, (c) the quality sequence, (d) the value of the <a href="#hisat2-options-seed"><code>--seed</code></a> option. This means that if two reads are identical (same name, same nucleotides, same qualities) HISAT2 will find and report the same alignment(s) for both, even if there was ambiguity. When <code>--non-deterministic</code> is specified, HISAT2 re-initializes its pseudo-random generator for each read using the current time. This means that HISAT2 will not necessarily report the same alignment for two identical reads. This is counter-intuitive for some users, but might be more appropriate in situations where the input consists of many identical reads.</p>

<h2 id="sam-output">SAM output</h2>
<p>Following is a brief description of the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">SAM</a> format as output by <code>hisat2</code>. For more details, see the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">SAM format specification</a>.</p>
<p>By default, <code>hisat2</code> prints a SAM header with <code>@HD</code>, <code>@SQ</code> and <code>@PG</code> lines. When one or more <a href="#hisat2-options-rg"><code>--rg</code></a> arguments are specified, <code>hisat2</code> will also print an <code>@RG</code> line that includes all user-specified <a href="#hisat2-options-rg"><code>--rg</code></a> tokens separated by tabs.</p>
<p>Each subsequnt line describes an alignment or, if the read failed to align, a read. Each line is a collection of at least 12 fields separated by tabs; from left to right, the fields are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Name of read that aligned.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">SAM specification</a> disallows whitespace in the read name. If the read name contains any whitespace characters, HISAT2 will truncate the name at the first whitespace character. This is similar to the behavior of other tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Sum of all applicable flags. Flags relevant to HISAT2 are:</p>

When the alignment of a read involves SNPs that are in the index, this option is used to indicate where exactly the read involves the SNPs. This optional field is similar to the above MD:Z field. For example, <code>Zs:Z:1|S|rs3747203,97|S|rs16990981</code> indicates the second base of the read corresponds to a known SNP (ID: rs3747203). 97 bases after the third base (the base after the second one), the read at 100th base involves another known SNP (ID: rs16990981). 'S' indicates a single nucleotide polymorphism. 'D' and 'I' indicate a deletion and an insertion, respectively.

<h1 id="the-hisat2-build-indexer">The <code>hisat2-build</code> indexer</h1>
<p><code>hisat2-build</code> builds a HISAT2 index from a set of DNA sequences. <code>hisat2-build</code> outputs a set of 6 files with suffixes <code>.1.ht2</code>, <code>.2.ht2</code>, <code>.3.ht2</code>, <code>.4.ht2</code>, <code>.5.ht2</code>, <code>.6.ht2</code>, <code>.7.ht2</code>, and <code>.8.ht2</code>. In the case of a large index these suffixes will have a <code>ht2l</code> termination. These files together constitute the index: they are all that is needed to align reads to that reference. The original sequence FASTA files are no longer used by HISAT2 once the index is built.</p>
<p>Use of Karkkainen's <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1314852">blockwise algorithm</a> allows <code>hisat2-build</code> to trade off between running time and memory usage. <code>hisat2-build</code> has three options governing how it makes this trade: [<code>-p</code>/<code>--packed</code>], <a href="#hisat2-build-options-bmax"><code>--bmax</code></a>/<a href="#hisat2-build-options-bmaxdivn"><code>--bmaxdivn</code></a>, and <a href="#hisat2-build-options-dcv"><code>--dcv</code></a>. By default, <code>hisat2-build</code> will automatically search for the settings that yield the best running time without exhausting memory. This behavior can be disabled using the <a href="#hisat2-build-options-a"><code>-a</code>/<code>--noauto</code></a> option.</p>
<p>The indexer provides options pertaining to the &quot;shape&quot; of the index, e.g. <a href="#hisat2-build-options-o"><code>--offrate</code></a> governs the fraction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler_transform">Burrows-Wheeler</a> rows that are &quot;marked&quot; (i.e., the density of the suffix-array sample; see the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index">FM Index</a> paper for details). All of these options are potentially profitable trade-offs depending on the application. They have been set to defaults that are reasonable for most cases according to our experiments. See <a href="#performance-tuning">Performance tuning</a> for details.</p>
<p><code>hisat2-build</code> can generate either <a href="#small-and-large-indexes">small or large indexes</a>. The wrapper will decide which based on the length of the input genome. If the reference does not exceed 4 billion characters but a large index is preferred, the user can specify <a href="#hisat2-build-options-large-index"><code>--large-index</code></a> to force <code>hisat2-build</code> to build a large index instead.</p>
<p>The HISAT2 index is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index">FM Index</a> of Ferragina and Manzini, which in turn is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler_transform">Burrows-Wheeler</a> transform. The algorithm used to build the index is based on the <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1314852">blockwise algorithm</a> of Karkkainen.</p>

<h1 id="getting-started-with-hisat2">Getting started with HISAT2</h1>
<p>HISAT2 comes with some example files to get you started. The example files are not scientifically significant; these files will simply let you start running HISAT2 and downstream tools right away.</p>
<p>First follow the manual instructions to <a href="#obtaining-hisat2">obtain HISAT2</a>. Set the <code>HISAT2_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the new HISAT2 directory containing the <code>hisat2</code>, <code>hisat2-build</code> and <code>hisat2-inspect</code> binaries. This is important, as the <code>HISAT2_HOME</code> variable is used in the commands below to refer to that directory.</p>
<h2 id="indexing-a-reference-genome">Indexing a reference genome</h2>
<p>To create an index for the genomic region (1 million bps from the human chromosome 22 between 20,000,000 and 20,999,999) included with HISAT2, create a new temporary directory (it doesn't matter where), change into that directory, and run:</p>
<pre><code>$HISAT2_HOME/hisat2-build $HISAT2_HOME/example/reference/22_20-21M.fa --snp $HISAT2_HOME/example/reference/22_20-21M.snp 22_20-21M_snp</code></pre>
<p>The command should print many lines of output then quit. When the command completes, the current directory will contain ten new files that all start with <code>22_20-21M_snp</code> and end with <code>.1.ht2</code>, <code>.2.ht2</code>, <code>.3.ht2</code>, <code>.4.ht2</code>, <code>.5.ht2</code>, <code>.6.ht2</code>, <code>.7.ht2</code>, and <code>.8.ht2</code>. These files constitute the index - you're done!</p>
<p>You can use <code>hisat2-build</code> to create an index for a set of FASTA files obtained from any source, including sites such as <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway">UCSC</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/genome">NCBI</a>, and <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a>. When indexing multiple FASTA files, specify all the files using commas to separate file names. For more details on how to create an index with <code>hisat2-build</code>, see the <a href="#the-hisat2-build-indexer">manual section on index building</a>. You may also want to bypass this process by obtaining a pre-built index.</p>
<h2 id="aligning-example-reads">Aligning example reads</h2>
<p>Stay in the directory created in the previous step, which now contains the <code>22_20-21M</code> index files. Next, run:</p>
<pre><code>$HISAT2_HOME/hisat2 -f -x $HISAT2_HOME/example/index/22_20-21M_snp -U $HISAT2_HOME/example/reads/reads_1.fa -S eg1.sam</code></pre>
<p>This runs the HISAT2 aligner, which aligns a set of unpaired reads to the the genome region using the index generated in the previous step. The alignment results in SAM format are written to the file <code>eg1.sam</code>, and a short alignment summary is written to the console. (Actually, the summary is written to the &quot;standard error&quot; or &quot;stderr&quot; filehandle, which is typically printed to the console.)</p>
<p>To see the first few lines of the SAM output, run:</p>
<pre><code>head eg1.sam</code></pre>
<p>You will see something like this:</p>

<p>The first few lines (beginning with <code>@</code>) are SAM header lines, and the rest of the lines are SAM alignments, one line per read or mate. See the <a href="#sam-output">HISAT2 manual section on SAM output</a> and the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">SAM specification</a> for details about how to interpret the SAM file format.</p>
<h2 id="paired-end-example">Paired-end example</h2>
<p>To align paired-end reads included with HISAT2, stay in the same directory and run:</p>
<pre><code>$HISAT2_HOME/hisat2 -f -x $HISAT2_HOME/example/index/22_20-21M_snp -1 $HISAT2_HOME/example/reads/reads_1.fa -2 $HISAT2_HOME/example/reads/reads_2.fa -S eg2.sam</code></pre>
<p>This aligns a set of paired-end reads to the reference genome, with results written to the file <code>eg2.sam</code>.</p>
<h2 id="using-samtoolsbcftools-downstream">Using SAMtools/BCFtools downstream</h2>
<p><a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net">SAMtools</a> is a collection of tools for manipulating and analyzing SAM and BAM alignment files. <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml">BCFtools</a> is a collection of tools for calling variants and manipulating VCF and BCF files, and it is typically distributed with <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net">SAMtools</a>. Using these tools together allows you to get from alignments in SAM format to variant calls in VCF format. This example assumes that <code>samtools</code> and <code>bcftools</code> are installed and that the directories containing these binaries are in your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH environment variable</a>.</p>
<p>Run the paired-end example:</p>
<pre><code>$HISAT2_HOME/hisat -f -x $HISAT2_HOME/example/index/22_20-21M_snp -1 $HISAT2_HOME/example/reads/reads_1.fa -2 $HISAT2_HOME/example/reads/reads_2.fa -S eg2.sam</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>samtools view</code> to convert the SAM file into a BAM file. BAM is a the binary format corresponding to the SAM text format. Run:</p>
<pre><code>samtools view -bS eg2.sam &gt; eg2.bam</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>samtools sort</code> to convert the BAM file to a sorted BAM file.</p>
<pre><code>samtools sort eg2.bam eg2.sorted</code></pre>
<p>We now have a sorted BAM file called <code>eg2.sorted.bam</code>. Sorted BAM is a useful format because the alignments are (a) compressed, which is convenient for long-term storage, and (b) sorted, which is conveneint for variant discovery. To generate variant calls in VCF format, run:</p>
<pre><code>samtools mpileup -uf $HISAT2_HOME/example/reference/22_20-21M.fa eg2.sorted.bam | bcftools view -bvcg - &gt; eg2.raw.bcf</code></pre>
<p>Then to view the variants, run:</p>
<pre><code>bcftools view eg2.raw.bcf</code></pre>
<p>See the official SAMtools guide to <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml">Calling SNPs/INDELs with SAMtools/BCFtools</a> for more details and variations on this process.</p>
