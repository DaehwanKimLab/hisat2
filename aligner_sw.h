 * aligner_sw.h
 *
 * Classes and routines for solving dynamic programming problems in aid of read
 * alignment.  Goals include the ability to handle:
 *
 * - Both read alignment, where the query must align end-to-end, and local
 *   alignment, where we seek a high-scoring alignment that need not involve
 *   the entire query.
 * - Situations where: (a) we've found a seed hit and are trying to extend it
 *   into a larger hit, (b) we've found an alignment for one mate of a pair and
 *   are trying to find a nearby alignment for the other mate, (c) we're
 *   aligning against an entire reference sequence.
 * - Caller-specified indicators for what columns of the dynamic programming
 *   matrix we are allowed to start in or end in.
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 * - A slicker way to filter out alignments that violate a ceiling placed on
 *   the number of Ns permitted in the reference portion of the alignment.
 *   Right now we accomplish this by masking out ending columns that correspond
 *   to *ungapped* alignments with too many Ns.  This results in false
 *   positives and false negatives for gapped alignments.  The margin of error
 *   (# of Ns by which we might miscount) is bounded by the number of gaps.

/**
 * SwAligner
 * =========
 *
 * Ensapsulates facilities for alignment using dynamic programming.  Handles
 * alignment of nucleotide reads against known reference nucleotides.
 *
 * The class is stateful.  First the user must call init() to initialize the
 * object with details regarding the dynamic programming problem to be solved.
 * Next, the user calls align() to fill the dynamic programming matrix and
 * calculate summaries describing the solutions.  Finally the user calls 
 * nextAlignment(...), perhaps repeatedly, to populate the SwResult object with
 * the next result.  Results are dispensend in best-to-worst, left-to-right
 * order.
 *
 * The class expects the read string, quality string, and reference string
 * provided by the caller live at least until the user is finished aligning and
 * obtaining alignments from this object.
 *
 * There is a design tradeoff between hiding/exposing details of the genome and
 * its strands to the SwAligner.  In a sense, a better design is to hide
 * details such as the id of the reference sequence aligned to, or whether
 * we're aligning the read in its original forward orientation or its reverse
 * complement.  But this means that any alignment results returned by SwAligner
 * have to be extended to include those details before they're useful to the
 * caller.  We opt for messy but expedient - the reference id and orientation
 * of the read are given to SwAligner, remembered, and used to populate
 * SwResults.
 *
 * LOCAL VS GLOBAL
 *
 * The dynamic programming aligner supports both local and global alignment,
 * and one option in between.  To implement global alignment, the aligner (a)
 * allows negative scores (i.e. doesn't necessarily clamp them up to 0), (b)
 * checks in rows other than the last row for acceptable solutions, and (c)
 * optionally adds a bonus to the score for matches.
 * 
 * For global alignment, we:
 *
 * (a) Allow negative scores
 * (b) Check only in the last row
 * (c) Either add a bonus for matches or not (doesn't matter)
 *
 * For local alignment, we:
 *
 * (a) Clamp scores to 0
 * (b) Check in any row for a sufficiently high score
 * (c) Add a bonus for matches
 *
 * An in-between solution is to allow alignments to be curtailed on the
 * right-hand side if a better score can be achieved thereby, but not on the
 * left.  For this, we:
 *
 * (a) Allow negative scores
 * (b) Check in any row for a sufficiently high score
 * (c) Either add a bonus for matches or not (doesn't matter)
 *
 * REDUNDANT ALIGNMENTS
 *
 * When are two alignments distinct and when are they redundant (not distinct)?
 * At one extreme, we might say the best alignment from any given dynamic
 * programming problem is redundant with all other alignments from that
 # problem.  At the other extreme, we might say that any two alignments with
 * distinct starting points and edits are distinct.  The former is probably too
 * conservative for mate-finding DP problems.  The latter is certainly too
 * permissive, since two alignments that differ only in how gaps are arranged
 * should not be considered distinct.
 *
 * Some in-between solutions are:
 *
 * (a) If two alignments share an end point on either end, they are redundant.
 *     Otherwise, they are distinct.
 * (b) If two alignments share *both* end points, they are redundant.
 * (c) If two alignments share any cells in the DP table, they are redundant.
 * (d) 2 alignments are redundant if either end within N poss of each other
 * (e) Like (d) but both instead of either
 * (f, g) Like d, e, but where N is tied to maxgaps somehow
 *
 * Why not (a)?  One reason is that it's possible for two alignments to have
 * different start & end positions but share many cells.  Consider alignments 1
 * and 2 below; their end-points are labeled.
 *
 *  1 2
 *  \ \
 *    -\
 *      \
 *       \
 *        \
 *        -\
 *        \ \
 *        1 2
 *
 * 1 and 2 are distinct according to (a) but they share many cells in common.
 *
 * Why not (f, g)?  It fixes the problem with (a) above by forcing the
 * alignments to be spread so far that they can't possibly share diagonal cells
 * in common
