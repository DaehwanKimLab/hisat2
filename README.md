# hisat2
HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive spliced alignment program for mapping RNA-seq reads. In addition to one global FM index that represents a whole genome, HISAT2 uses a large set of small FM indexes that collectively cover the whole genome (each index represents a genomic region of ~64,000 bp and ~48,000 indexes are needed to cover the human genome). These small indexes (called local indexes) combined with several alignment strategies enable effective alignment of RNA-seq reads, in particular, reads spanning multiple exons. The memory footprint of HISAT is relatively low (~4.3GB for the human genome). I have developed HISAT2 based on the Bowtie2 implementation to handle most of the operations on the FM index.
